quick readme for usage!

compile and run, and hopefully having the rom as "bootrom.bin" in the same area as the exe will work. it should then decompress to "decompressed_output.bin" after it is done processing.

you may have to move the files around. in rider, i had to move the bootrom to the same folder where the source was housed, NOT where the debug exe was generated. weird.
